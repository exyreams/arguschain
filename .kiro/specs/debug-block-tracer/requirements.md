# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Debug Block Tracer is an advanced blockchain analysis tool that leverages `debug_traceBlockByNumber` and `debug_traceBlockByHash` to provide comprehensive detailed execution traces for all transactions within a specific block. This feature enables deep inspection of block-level transaction execution patterns, internal contract calls, PYUSD token flow analysis, and multi-transaction relationship visualization through interactive analytics and detailed trace processing.
