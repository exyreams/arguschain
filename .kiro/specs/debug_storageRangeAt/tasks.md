## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Each task should be implemented with comprehensive error handling from the start
- Components should be built with performance optimization for large datasets
- All features should work with both real and mock data for testing flexibility
- Storage analysis accuracy should be validated against known contract patterns

### Quality Gates

- All components must pass accessibility audits before deployment
- Performance must remain acceptable with large storage dumps (1000+ slots)
- Storage interpretation accuracy must be validated with known contracts
- All features must work across supported browsers and devices
- Pattern detection accuracy must meet minimum confidence thresholds

### Dependencies

- Tasks should be completed in numerical order where possible
- Some tasks can be parallelized (e.g., different visualization components in tasks 7-10)
- Integration testing should happen after major component groups are completed
- User feedback should be incorporated between major milestones

### Storage Analysis Considerations

- Always validate block hash format and existence before RPC calls
- Implement proper error handling for contracts that don't exist at specified blocks
- Use efficient batch processing for mapping analysis with many keys
- Cache storage analysis results to avoid repeated expensive RPC calls
- Provide clear feedback about the computational cost of large storage analysis operations
