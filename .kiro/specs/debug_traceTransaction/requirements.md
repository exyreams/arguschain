# Transaction Analytics Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive analytics features for both StructLog and TransactionTracer methods in the Arguschain Transaction Deep Dive page. The goal is to transform raw transaction tracing data into meaningful visual analytics that help developers understand transaction execution patterns, gas usage, contract interactions, and performance bottlenecks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: StructLog Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want to visualize opcode-level execution data from StructLog traces, so that I can understand low-level transaction performance and identify optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a StructLog trace is available THEN the system SHALL display an "Opcode Analytics" section with interactive visualizations
2. WHEN displaying opcode data THEN the system SHALL show a pie chart of opcode categories with percentages and gas usage
3. WHEN displaying execution flow THEN the system SHALL show a timeline chart of opcode execution steps with gas costs
4. WHEN showing memory usage THEN the system SHALL display a line chart tracking stack depth and memory size over execution steps
5. WHEN displaying performance metrics THEN the system SHALL highlight the top 10 most expensive opcodes with gas costs and execution counts
6. WHEN user hovers over chart elements THEN the system SHALL show detailed tooltips with opcode names, gas costs, and execution context
7. WHEN execution data exceeds 1000 steps THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtualization for performance

### Requirement 2: TransactionTracer Call Flow Analytics

**User Story:** As a DeFi analyst, I want to visualize contract interaction patterns from TransactionTracer data, so that I can understand how contracts communicate and where value flows in complex transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TransactionTracer result is available THEN the system SHALL display a "Call Flow Analytics" section with interactive network diagrams
2. WHEN displaying contract interactions THEN the system SHALL show a node-link graph where nodes represent contracts and edges represent calls
3. WHEN showing gas attribution THEN the system SHALL display a horizontal bar chart showing gas usage by contract address
4. WHEN displaying call hierarchy THEN the system SHALL show an interactive tree diagram with expandable/collapsible nodes
5. WHEN showing value transfers THEN the system SHALL highlight ETH transfers with colored edges and transfer amounts
6. WHEN displaying call success rates THEN the system SHALL use color coding (green for success, red for errors) on all visual elements
7. WHEN user clicks on a contract node THEN the system SHALL show a detailed panel with contract information, function calls, and gas usage
8. WHEN displaying large call trees THEN the system SHALL implement zoom and pan functionality for navigation

### Requirement 3: Unified Gas Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a smart contract auditor, I want to see comprehensive gas usage analytics that combine data from both tracing methods, so that I can identify gas inefficiencies and optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both StructLog and TransactionTracer data are available THEN the system SHALL display a unified "Gas Analytics" dashboard
2. WHEN showing gas breakdown THEN the system SHALL display a stacked bar chart comparing gas usage by contract vs opcode categories
3. WHEN displaying gas efficiency metrics THEN the system SHALL calculate and show gas per operation ratios and efficiency scores
4. WHEN showing cost analysis THEN the system SHALL display gas costs in both Wei and USD (using current ETH price)
5. WHEN comparing execution paths THEN the system SHALL highlight the most expensive execution branches
6. WHEN displaying optimization suggestions THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations based on gas usage patterns
7. WHEN gas usage exceeds network averages THEN the system SHALL display warning indicators and optimization tips

### Requirement 4: Interactive Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As a blockchain researcher, I want interactive performance metrics and comparisons, so that I can analyze transaction efficiency and benchmark against similar transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transaction analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display key performance indicators (KPIs) in metric cards
2. WHEN showing execution metrics THEN the system SHALL display total execution time, average gas per step, and efficiency ratios
3. WHEN displaying comparative metrics THEN the system SHALL show how the transaction compares to network averages
4. WHEN user selects time ranges THEN the system SHALL allow filtering of execution data by step ranges or time windows
5. WHEN showing bottlenecks THEN the system SHALL highlight the top 5 most expensive operations with optimization suggestions
6. WHEN displaying trends THEN the system SHALL show gas usage trends over the execution timeline
7. WHEN metrics indicate inefficiencies THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for gas optimization

### Requirement 5: Data Export and Sharing

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to export analytics data and share insights with my team, so that we can collaborate on transaction optimization and debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analytics are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide export options for charts as PNG/SVG images
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow CSV/JSON export of raw analytics data
3. WHEN sharing insights THEN the system SHALL generate shareable URLs that preserve the current analysis state
4. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report with key findings and recommendations
5. WHEN saving analysis THEN the system SHALL allow users to bookmark specific transaction analyses
6. WHEN comparing transactions THEN the system SHALL support side-by-side comparison of multiple transaction analyses

### Requirement 6: Real-time Analytics Updates

**User Story:** As a DApp developer, I want real-time updates of analytics as new tracing data becomes available, so that I can see analysis results as they are processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracing is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading states with progress indicators for each analytics section
2. WHEN partial data is available THEN the system SHALL display preliminary analytics and update them as more data arrives
3. WHEN tracing fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error states with retry options for each analytics component
4. WHEN data is updated THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate chart transitions without jarring visual changes
5. WHEN multiple traces are running THEN the system SHALL show independent loading states for StructLog and TransactionTracer sections
6. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation and summary of available analytics

### Requirement 7: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want to access transaction analytics on various devices and screen sizes, so that I can analyze transactions regardless of my current device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN all analytics charts SHALL be responsive and touch-friendly
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all charts SHALL provide alternative text descriptions and data tables
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via keyboard shortcuts
4. WHEN displaying on small screens THEN charts SHALL stack vertically and maintain readability
5. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN all visual elements SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios
6. WHEN zooming to 200% THEN all text and interactive elements SHALL remain usable and readable
7. WHEN using different color vision types THEN charts SHALL use patterns and shapes in addition to colors for differentiation
