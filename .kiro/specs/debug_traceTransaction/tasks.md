## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Each task should be implemented with test-driven development
- Components should be built with responsive design from the start
- All analytics should work with both real and mock data
- Performance considerations should be built in from the beginning

### Quality Gates

- All components must pass accessibility audits
- Charts must render correctly with datasets of varying sizes
- Performance must remain acceptable with large transaction traces
- All features must work across supported browsers and devices

### Dependencies

- Tasks should be completed in order within each phase
- Some tasks can be parallelized (e.g., different chart components)
- Integration testing should happen after each phase completion
- User feedback should be incorporated between phases
