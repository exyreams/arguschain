5. WHEN visualization fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback text-based representations and clear error messages
6. WHEN diagrams are created THEN the system SHALL support different output formats and responsive display

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a blockchain data analyst, I want to export comprehensive analysis results, so that I can share findings, create reports, and perform further analysis in external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide JSON export functionality with complete analysis data
2. WHEN Google Sheets integration is available THEN the system SHALL export formatted analysis results to new spreadsheets
