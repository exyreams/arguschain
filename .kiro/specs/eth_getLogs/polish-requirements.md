3. WHEN analyzing participants THEN the system SHALL provide sortable tables with filtering and search capabilities
4. WHEN showing statistics THEN the system SHALL include trend indicators and comparative metrics
5. WHEN rendering large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization for optimal performance
6. WHEN charts fail to render THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content and error recovery options

### Requirement 4: Improve Form Controls and User Input

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive and responsive form controls, so that I can easily configure my analysis parameters and get immediate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering block ranges THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation with helpful error messages
2. WHEN selecting networks THEN the system SHALL show clear network status and connection indicators
3. WHEN using quick range buttons THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and proper state updates
4. WHEN advanced settings are toggled THEN the system SHALL show smooth animations and proper layout adjustments
5. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight specific fields and provide actionable error messages
6. WHEN submitting analysis requests THEN the system SHALL disable controls appropriately and show progress indicators

### Requirement 5: Optimize Performance and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and responsive interactions, so that I can efficiently analyze large datasets without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading with clear progress indicators
2. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL cache content appropriately to avoid unnecessary re-rendering
3. WHEN rendering charts THEN the system SHALL optimize for smooth interactions and responsive updates
4. WHEN handling user interactions THEN the system SHALL debounce inputs and provide immediate visual feedback
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup strategies and garbage collection
6. WHEN network requests are slow THEN the system SHALL provide timeout handling and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6: Enhance Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want full keyboard navigation and screen reader support, so that I can use all features of the logs analyzer effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide logical tab order and visible focus indicators
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce dynamic content changes and provide proper ARIA labels
3. WHEN viewing charts THEN the system SHALL provide alternative text descriptions and data table alternatives
4. WHEN interacting with controls THEN the system SHALL support keyboard shortcuts and proper focus management
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL announce them to assistive technologies with clear descriptions
6. WHEN content updates THEN the system SHALL use live regions to inform screen reader users of changes

### Requirement 7: Complete Export and Sharing Features

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive export capabilities, so that I can share findings and conduct further analysis in external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV, JSON, and formatted report options
2. WHEN generating exports THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive metadata and analysis results
3. WHEN export operations are large THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
4. WHEN exports fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
5. WHEN sharing results THEN the system SHALL generate shareable URLs with analysis parameters
6. WHEN printing reports THEN the system SHALL provide print-optimized layouts and formatting

### Requirement 8: Implement Advanced Analytics Features

**User Story:** As a DeFi analyst, I want advanced analytics capabilities, so that I can identify patterns, anomalies, and insights in token transfer data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing transfer patterns THEN the system SHALL identify and highlight unusual activity or anomalies
2. WHEN viewing network analysis THEN the system SHALL calculate and display centrality metrics and hub identification
3. WHEN examining temporal data THEN the system SHALL provide trend analysis and pattern recognition
4. WHEN comparing time periods THEN the system SHALL offer comparative analytics and change detection
5. WHEN detecting large transfers THEN the system SHALL highlight whale activity and significant movements
6. WHEN analyzing contract interactions THEN the system SHALL provide contract-specific insights and categorization
