# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ETH Logs Analyzer is a comprehensive blockchain log analysis feature that enables users to fetch, analyze, and visualize ERC-20 token transfer events using the `eth_getLogs` RPC method. This feature provides deep insights into token transfer patterns, volume analytics, and network flow visualization with support for multiple blockchain networks and export capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blockchain analyst, I want to fetch ERC-20 token transfer logs using eth_getLogs, so that I can analyze token movement patterns across different blocks and networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies a block range and token contract address THEN the system SHALL fetch transfer logs using eth_getLogs RPC method
2. WHEN using Google Blockchain API THEN the system SHALL respect the 5-block maximum range limitation
3. WHEN using standard Web3 providers THEN the system SHALL support larger block ranges with proper error handling
4. WHEN logs are fetched successfully THEN the system SHALL parse and decode ERC-20 Transfer events with from/to addresses and values
5. WHEN no logs are found in the specified range THEN the system SHALL display an informative message
6. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting hints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DeFi researcher, I want to analyze token transfer statistics and patterns, so that I can understand token distribution and usage metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transfer logs are successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL calculate comprehensive statistics including total volume, average transfer size, and unique participants
2. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL show total transfers, total volume, average/median/min/max transfer amounts, and unique sender/receiver counts
3. WHEN analyzing top participants THEN the system SHALL identify and rank top senders and receivers by volume and transaction count
4. WHEN calculating percentages THEN the system SHALL show each participant's percentage of total volume
5. WHEN displaying addresses THEN the system SHALL use shortened address format for better readability
6. WHEN handling decimal precision THEN the system SHALL format token amounts according to the token's decimal configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want to visualize token transfer data through interactive charts, so that I can identify patterns and anomalies in token flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transfer data is available THEN the system SHALL generate a transfer size distribution histogram
2. WHEN timestamp data is available THEN the system SHALL create a volume over time line chart with hourly aggregation
3. WHEN displaying large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement range sliders and outlier handling for better visualization
4. WHEN showing transfer flows THEN the system SHALL create a Sankey diagram displaying the top 50 transfer relationships
5. WHEN rendering charts THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the application theme
6. WHEN charts fail to render THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle visualization errors without breaking the analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want to export analysis results in multiple formats, so that I can share findings and conduct further analysis in external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide CSV export functionality with direct download
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide JSON export with structured analysis results including statistics and top participants
3. WHEN Google Sheets integration is available THEN the system SHALL support direct export to Google Sheets with formatted data
4. WHEN exports are generated THEN the system SHALL include timestamps in filenames for version control
5. WHEN Google Sheets export fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to CSV download with error notification
6. WHEN exporting to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL create properly formatted sheets with headers, statistics, and transfer data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a blockchain infrastructure engineer, I want the system to handle multiple networks and RPC configurations, so that I can analyze logs across different blockchain environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to different networks THEN the system SHALL support Ethereum mainnet, testnets, and custom RPC endpoints
2. WHEN using different RPC providers THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and adapt to provider-specific limitations
3. WHEN formatting block parameters THEN the system SHALL handle hex strings, integers, and block tags (latest, pending, earliest)
4. WHEN making RPC calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling for network failures and invalid responses
5. WHEN caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL cache block timestamps to avoid redundant queries
6. WHEN switching networks THEN the system SHALL maintain proper Web3 client connections and configurations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user interface designer, I want the log analyzer to integrate seamlessly with the existing Arguschain interface, so that users have a consistent and intuitive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the log analyzer THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated page with proper routing
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the existing design system
3. WHEN showing loading states THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate progress indicators
4. WHEN handling user interactions THEN the system SHALL implement proper form validation and error states
5. WHEN displaying data tables THEN the system SHALL use responsive design for mobile compatibility
6. WHEN providing export options THEN the system SHALL use intuitive button layouts and clear labeling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the log analyzer to handle large datasets efficiently, so that I can analyze high-volume token transfers without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization for data tables and charts
2. WHEN fetching logs THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading with appropriate batch sizes
3. WHEN rendering visualizations THEN the system SHALL optimize chart performance for datasets with thousands of entries
4. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies to reduce redundant API calls
5. WHEN handling memory usage THEN the system SHALL implement proper cleanup and garbage collection
6. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL provide pagination or virtualization for large result sets

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an accessibility-focused user, I want the log analyzer to be fully accessible, so that I can use screen readers and keyboard navigation effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
3. WHEN displaying charts THEN the system SHALL provide alternative text descriptions and data tables
4. WHEN showing color-coded information THEN the system SHALL not rely solely on color for meaning
5. WHEN providing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL ensure proper focus management
6. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL announce them to assistive technologies
