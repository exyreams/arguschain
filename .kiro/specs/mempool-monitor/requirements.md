# Mempool Monitor Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Mempool Monitor feature in Arguschain that leverages the `txpool_status` and `txpool_content` RPC methods for real-time network congestion analysis and transaction pool monitoring. The goal is to provide insights into network conditions, gas price recommendations, and PYUSD-specific transaction activity in the mempool.
