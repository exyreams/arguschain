## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Each task should be implemented with cost-conscious development practices
- Components should be built with performance optimization for real-time updates
- All features should work with both real and mock data to minimize RPC costs during development
- Cost management and warnings should be integrated from the beginning

### Quality Gates

- All components must pass accessibility audits before deployment
- Performance must remain acceptable with large transaction pools (10,000+ transactions)
- Cost management features must be thoroughly tested and validated
- All features must work across supported browsers and devices
- Real-time update performance must meet responsiveness requirements

### Dependencies

- Tasks should be completed in numerical order where possible
- Some tasks can be parallelized (e.g., different visualization components in tasks 6-8)
- Integration testing should happen after major component groups are completed
- User feedback should be incorporated between major milestones

### Cost Management Considerations

- Always implement cost warnings before expensive operations
- Use mock data extensively during development to avoid unnecessary RPC costs
- Implement comprehensive caching to avoid repeated expensive calls
- Provide clear cost breakdowns and user confirmation for expensive operations
- Track and report actual costs vs. estimates for optimization
