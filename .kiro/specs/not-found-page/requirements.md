# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Not Found Page feature provides users with a helpful and visually appealing page when they navigate to non-existent routes within the Arguschain application. This page maintains the application's design consistency while providing clear guidance to help users navigate back to valid content. The implementation includes both a standalone component-based page and an integrated page with full navigation, serving as fallbacks for all unmatched routes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Design and Branding

**User Story:** As a user who encounters a broken link, I want to see a visually consistent error page that maintains the Arguschain branding, so that I know I'm still within the application and feel confident about the platform's professionalism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a non-existent route THEN the system SHALL display a 404 error page with the Arguschain dark theme styling
2. WHEN the 404 page loads THEN the system SHALL display an error illustration as the primary visual element
3. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL use the same color scheme and typography as the rest of the application (bg-dark-primary, text-primary, accent-primary)
4. WHEN the error page is displayed THEN the system SHALL include the Arguschain logo and branding elements
5. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a clear "404" error code prominently
6. WHEN the illustration is shown THEN the system SHALL ensure proper sizing and responsive behavior

### Requirement 2: User-Friendly Messaging

**User Story:** As a user who encounters a 404 error, I want to understand what happened and what I can do next, so that I can quickly get back to using the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the error message appears THEN the system SHALL provide a brief, non-technical explanation of what a 404 error means
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL suggest specific actions the user can take to resolve the issue
4. WHEN error text is displayed THEN the system SHALL use encouraging, helpful language rather than technical jargon
5. WHEN the message is shown THEN the system SHALL maintain a professional but approachable tone consistent with the Arguschain brand

### Requirement 3: Navigation and Recovery Options

**User Story:** As a user on the 404 page, I want multiple ways to navigate back to useful content, so that I can quickly recover from the error and continue my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 404 page loads THEN the system SHALL provide a prominent "Go to Dashboard" button as the primary call-to-action
2. WHEN navigation options are displayed THEN the system SHALL include a "Go Back" button that uses browser history navigation
3. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL display quick navigation links to important pages
4. WHEN quick links are shown THEN the system SHALL include: Dashboard, Debug Trace, and Transaction Analysis pages
5. WHEN any navigation button is clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate page
6. WHEN the user hovers over navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user accessing the 404 page on any device or using assistive technology, I want the page to be fully accessible and properly formatted, so that I can understand the error and navigate regardless of my device or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 404 page loads on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display all content in a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN the page is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and readability
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
4. WHEN navigating with keyboard only THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements are focusable and have visible focus indicators
5. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL set appropriate page title for SEO and accessibility
6. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL include descriptive alt text for illustrations
7. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

### Requirement 5: Performance and Loading

**User Story:** As a user encountering a 404 error, I want the error page to load quickly and smoothly, so that I don't experience additional frustration while trying to recover from the navigation issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a 404 error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the error page quickly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the 404 page THEN the system SHALL use modular, reusable components
2. WHEN building components THEN the system SHALL provide proper TypeScript interfaces and props
3. WHEN creating the page THEN the system SHALL support configuration through props and default settings

5. WHEN building the architecture THEN the system SHALL separate concerns between layout, content, and navigation

### Requirement 7: Integration with Application Routing

5. WHEN routing to the 404 page THEN the system SHALL provide consistent user experience
6. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL properly handle both authenticated and unauthenticated user states
