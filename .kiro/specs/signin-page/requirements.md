# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the signin page UI components for Arguschain that provides an intuitive and secure authentication interface. The signin page serves as the primary entry point for users to access the blockchain analysis platform, integrating with Supabase Auth to support email/password and OAuth authentication methods while maintaining the platform's professional design aesthetic and developer-focused user experience.

**Note:** The Supabase Auth setup (client configuration, OAuth providers, email services) is implemented in the `user-auth-setup` spec. This spec focuses on the frontend UI components, user experience, and integration with the existing authentication system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want a clear and welcoming signin interface, so that I can easily understand how to access the platform and choose the best authentication method for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the signin page THEN the system SHALL display a clean, professional interface with Arguschain branding and animated logo
2. WHEN a user views the signin options THEN the system SHALL clearly present both email/password and OAuth authentication methods (Google, GitHub, Discord)
3. WHEN a user sees the signin form THEN the system SHALL include helpful text and typewriter animation explaining the platform's purpose
4. WHEN a user is on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive design with proper layout adaptation for all device sizes
5. IF a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard automatically using session detection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with email and password, so that I can access my account using traditional credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their email and password THEN the system SHALL validate the input format in real-time
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message without revealing whether the email or password was incorrect
4. WHEN a user makes multiple failed attempts THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s) to prevent brute force attacks
5. IF a user's account requires email verification THEN the system SHALL display a message prompting them to check their email

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with GitHub, Discord, or Google using OAuth integration, so that I can quickly access the platform using my existing accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks OAuth provider buttons THEN the system SHALL display three buttons in a grid layout with proper icons for Google, GitHub, and Discord
2. WHEN OAuth authentication is initiated THEN the system SHALL call Supabase's signInWithOAuth() method with the appropriate provider and redirect URL
3. WHEN OAuth authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL update signin preferences and redirect to the dashboard
4. WHEN OAuth fails for any provider THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with proper error handling
5. IF OAuth provider authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and disable other buttons to prevent duplicate requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to easily switch between signin and signup modes, so that I can create an account or sign in as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the signin page THEN the system SHALL display a clear link to switch to signup mode within the same page
2. WHEN a user clicks the signup link THEN the system SHALL switch to signup mode and update the URL parameters while preserving redirect parameters
3. WHEN a user switches modes THEN the system SHALL update the page title and form content appropriately with smooth transitions
4. WHEN a user is in signup mode THEN the system SHALL provide a link to switch back to signin mode
5. IF a user navigates to /signup directly THEN the system SHALL redirect to /signin with mode=signup parameter

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who forgot their password, I want to reset it, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot password?" THEN the system SHALL display a password reset form
2. WHEN a user enters their email for password reset THEN the system SHALL send a reset link and confirm the action
3. WHEN a user submits a password reset request THEN the system SHALL always show success message (to prevent email enumeration)
4. WHEN a user clicks a valid reset link THEN the system SHALL allow them to set a new password
5. IF a reset link is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error and offer to send a new link

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during the signin process, so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the signin form THEN the system SHALL show a loading state with appropriate visual feedback
2. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable the form to prevent duplicate submissions
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display specific, actionable error messages
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages with retry options
5. IF the signin process takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide reassuring feedback about the process

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the signin page to be fully accessible, so that I can authenticate regardless of my abilities or assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard only THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators and logical tab order
2. WHEN a user uses a screen reader THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and announcements
3. WHEN a user has visual impairments THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL announce them to screen readers and associate them with relevant form fields
5. IF a user needs larger text THEN the system SHALL scale appropriately without breaking the layout

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want the signin process to remember my preferences, so that I can quickly access the platform with minimal friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has previously signed in THEN the system SHALL remember their email address if they checked "Remember my email address"
2. WHEN a user returns to the signin page THEN the system SHALL pre-fill their email and focus on the password field if email is remembered
3. WHEN a user successfully signs in THEN the system SHALL update signin preferences with last signin method and redirect to intended destination
4. WHEN a user signs out and returns THEN the system SHALL preserve email preference while clearing sensitive session data
5. IF a user's session expired THEN the system SHALL redirect to signin with proper redirect parameters to return to their intended page
