4. WHEN displaying transaction list THEN the system SHALL show per-transaction PYUSD metrics with sorting and filtering
5. WHEN visualizing block activity THEN the system SHALL create heatmaps and distribution charts for PYUSD operations
6. WHEN showing state changes THEN the system SHALL aggregate state modifications by type and display distribution charts
7. WHEN analyzing security THEN the system SHALL identify and highlight any security-relevant events across all transactions

### Requirement 5: Advanced Gas and Performance Analytics

**User Story:** As a smart contract developer, I want detailed gas analysis from replay data, so that I can optimize PYUSD contract interactions and identify gas inefficiencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replay data includes gas metrics THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive gas usage analytics
2. WHEN showing gas breakdown THEN the system SHALL categorize gas usage by PYUSD function types (transfer, mint, burn, approve)
3. WHEN displaying efficiency metrics THEN the system SHALL calculate and show gas efficiency scores for different operation types
4. WHEN comparing operations THEN the system SHALL benchmark gas usage against typical ranges for each function type
5. WHEN showing optimization suggestions THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for gas reduction
6. WHEN displaying VM traces THEN the system SHALL show opcode-level execution with gas costs and storage operations
7. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL highlight the most expensive operations and bottlenecks

### Requirement 6: Interactive Data Exploration

**User Story:** As a blockchain analyst, I want interactive tools to explore replay data, so that I can drill down into specific aspects of transaction execution and state changes.
