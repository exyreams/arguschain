## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Each task should be implemented with cost-conscious development practices
- Components should be built with performance optimization from the start
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms should be built in from the beginning

### Quality Gates

- All components must pass accessibility audits before deployment
- Performance must remain acceptable with large replay datasets
- Cost management features must be thoroughly validated
- All features must work across supported browsers and devices
- Security analysis accuracy must be validated with known test cases

### Dependencies

- Tasks should be completed in numerical order where possible
- Some tasks can be parallelized (e.g., different visualization components in tasks 9-12)
- User feedback should be incorporated between major milestones to optimize cost-effectiveness
