# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Block Trace Analyzer is an advanced blockchain analysis tool that leverages `trace_block` to provide comprehensive analysis of all transactions within a specific block. This feature enables deep inspection of block-level transaction patterns, gas usage analysis, PYUSD token flow visualization, and multi-transaction relationship analysis through interactive visualizations and detailed analytics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blockchain analyst, I want to trace all transactions in a block using trace_block, so that I can analyze block-level patterns, gas usage, and transaction relationships comprehensively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a block identifier THEN the system SHALL fetch all transaction traces using trace_block RPC method
2. WHEN block traces are retrieved THEN the system SHALL parse and categorize each transaction by type (ETH Transfer, Contract Call, PYUSD Transfer, etc.)
3. WHEN trace_block is called THEN the system SHALL handle both hex block numbers and block tags (latest, pending, earliest)
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track execution time and provide performance feedback
5. WHEN trace_block fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
6. WHEN large blocks are processed THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and performance warnings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DeFi researcher, I want to analyze PYUSD token flows within a block, so that I can understand token movement patterns and identify significant transfers or approvals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions are categorized THEN the system SHALL identify PYUSD-related transactions and extract detailed information
2. WHEN PYUSD transfers are detected THEN the system SHALL decode function calls, parameters, amounts, and events
3. WHEN PYUSD approvals are found THEN the system SHALL extract owner, spender, and approval amounts
4. WHEN PYUSD transactions are analyzed THEN the system SHALL calculate total transfer volume and unique participants
5. WHEN token flow analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate flow diagrams showing transfer relationships
6. WHEN PYUSD data is processed THEN the system SHALL handle failed transactions and provide appropriate status indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a gas optimization engineer, I want to analyze gas usage patterns across different transaction types in a block, so that I can identify optimization opportunities and understand block efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN block traces are processed THEN the system SHALL calculate gas usage by transaction category
2. WHEN gas analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL provide statistics including total gas, average gas per transaction, and percentage distribution
3. WHEN displaying gas data THEN the system SHALL create interactive visualizations showing gas distribution across transaction types
4. WHEN analyzing PYUSD transactions THEN the system SHALL provide gas usage breakdown by function type
5. WHEN gas patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL highlight high-gas transactions and efficiency metrics
6. WHEN comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL show PYUSD vs other transaction gas usage ratios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blockchain security auditor, I want to visualize transaction relationships and token flows within a block, so that I can identify suspicious patterns and analyze complex transaction sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PYUSD transfers are identified THEN the system SHALL create flow diagrams using Graphviz visualization
2. WHEN generating flow diagrams THEN the system SHALL show top transfers by amount with proper node and edge styling
3. WHEN displaying relationships THEN the system SHALL use shortened addresses with full address tooltips
4. WHEN failed transactions exist THEN the system SHALL indicate them with different visual styling (dashed edges)
5. WHEN complex flows are present THEN the system SHALL limit visualization to top flows to maintain readability
6. WHEN diagrams cannot be generated THEN the system SHALL provide fallback text-based representations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a transaction analyst, I want to view detailed transaction data with filtering and sorting capabilities, so that I can focus on specific transaction types and analyze patterns efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN block analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive transaction tables with all relevant data
2. WHEN viewing transactions THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options for PYUSD-only and all transactions
3. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL show transaction hash, addresses, values, gas usage, type, and status
4. WHEN large datasets are present THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or limiting for performance
5. WHEN transactions are sorted THEN the system SHALL provide sorting by gas usage, value, and transaction type
6. WHEN detailed views are needed THEN the system SHALL show full transaction details with expandable sections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to export comprehensive block analysis results, so that I can share findings, create reports, and perform further analysis in external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide CSV export functionality with complete transaction data
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide JSON export with structured analysis results and metadata
3. WHEN Google Sheets integration is available THEN the system SHALL export formatted analysis results to new spreadsheets
4. WHEN exports are generated THEN the system SHALL include block number, timestamps, and analysis metadata
5. WHEN export operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options and clear error messaging
6. WHEN exports are successful THEN the system SHALL provide direct download links and proper file naming

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the block tracer to handle large blocks efficiently, so that I can analyze high-activity blocks without performance degradation or timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large blocks THEN the system SHALL implement efficient trace processing with progress tracking
2. WHEN API calls are expensive THEN the system SHALL provide execution time feedback and performance warnings
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement proper cleanup and garbage collection strategies
4. WHEN rendering visualizations THEN the system SHALL optimize chart performance for large datasets
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL implement virtualization or pagination for large result sets
6. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear timeout and resource limit messaging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user interface designer, I want the block tracer to provide an intuitive interface with rich formatting, so that users can easily navigate complex block analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use rich console formatting with colors, tables, and panels
2. WHEN showing analysis progress THEN the system SHALL provide clear loading states and progress indicators
3. WHEN presenting data THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with ArgusChain design system
4. WHEN displaying large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL organize information into logical sections with clear headers
5. WHEN providing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL implement proper button layouts and user feedback
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a blockchain infrastructure engineer, I want the block tracer to integrate seamlessly with existing ArgusChain architecture, so that it maintains consistency with other analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with ArgusChain THEN the system SHALL use existing blockchain service patterns and configurations
2. WHEN making RPC calls THEN the system SHALL leverage existing Web3 client management and error handling
