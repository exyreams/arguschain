# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the core Supabase Auth setup and configuration for Arguschain's authentication system. The focus is on establishing the foundational authentication infrastructure using Supabase's built-in authentication service, including client setup, database integration, and core authentication utilities. This setup provides a comprehensive authentication foundation with React hooks, TanStack Query integration, and TypeScript types that will be consumed by the signin-page and other authentication-related features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Supabase Auth properly configured and integrated, so that the authentication system has a solid foundation for all authentication methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase Auth is configured THEN the system SHALL connect to Supabase with proper project URL and anonymous key from environment variables
2. WHEN the auth client initializes THEN the system SHALL automatically handle session persistence, token refresh, and PKCE flow for security
3. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate all required Supabase credentials and throw clear errors if missing
4. WHEN authentication requests are made THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's built-in authentication methods (signInWithPassword, signInWithOAuth, etc.)
5. IF Supabase connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and proper error handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, Discord) properly configured in Supabase, so that users can authenticate using their existing accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth providers are configured in Supabase dashboard THEN the system SHALL validate redirect URLs and provider settings
2. WHEN OAuth flow is initiated THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's signInWithOAuth method with proper provider configuration
3. WHEN OAuth authentication succeeds THEN Supabase SHALL automatically create or link user accounts with proper email and profile information
4. WHEN OAuth fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages using Supabase's error handling
5. IF OAuth provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback without breaking the authentication flow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React hooks properly configured for Supabase Auth, so that frontend components can easily interact with the authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React hooks are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide useAuth, useUser, useSession, and useAuthActions hooks
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the hooks SHALL automatically update with real-time auth state changes via onAuthStateChange
3. WHEN auth operations are performed THEN the hooks SHALL provide loading states, error handling, and proper cleanup
4. WHEN components use the hooks THEN the system SHALL provide reactive session monitoring and user state management
5. IF authentication operations fail THEN the hooks SHALL provide structured error handling with user-friendly messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TanStack Query integration for authentication operations, so that the frontend can efficiently manage authentication state and API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication queries are defined THEN the system SHALL provide useAuthSession, useAuthUser, useSignIn, useSignUp, and related query hooks
2. WHEN mutations are configured THEN the system SHALL handle signOut, updateUser, password updates, and email operations with proper cache invalidation
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL implement proper stale time (5 minutes), retry logic, and error handling
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL provide cache management utilities like clearAuthCache and prefetchAuthData
5. IF network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms with structured error responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want email verification and password reset features properly configured, so that users have secure account management options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email verification is configured THEN the system SHALL provide verifyOtp method for email confirmation with proper token validation
2. WHEN password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL use resetPasswordForEmail method with proper redirect URLs to reset password page
3. WHEN email operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide resend functionality for signup and email change confirmations
4. WHEN user updates are needed THEN the system SHALL provide updateUser method for email, password, and metadata changes
5. IF email operations fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and provide structured error responses with user-friendly messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript types and error handling for authentication, so that the authentication system is type-safe and provides clear error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN types are defined THEN the system SHALL provide complete TypeScript interfaces for AuthUser, AuthSession, AuthState, and all request/response types
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured error handling with proper error mapping and user-friendly messages
3. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive validation utilities for email, password, username, and form validation
4. WHEN authentication operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling with rate limiting and progressive delays
5. IF type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear TypeScript compilation errors and proper type exports
